# Python-Logger

Simple web crawer that loggs the songs being played on "The Voice radio" every minute from their website. 

... The task?

In 2016 'The Voice radio' anounced a giveaway of 10 tickets for a Scrillex concert.  The task was to listen to the radio
and when the listener hears a Scrillex song, he should fill out a form with the song name and the time it was played on 
the radio. 

... Bace Bogo's solution?

Write a bot to do all the work, and just fill out the form afterwards. 

... The aftermath?

The bot did not won me any tickets :( 
But it was just the begining of something much greater...
